# EMG-Controlled-Prosthetic-Hand
A project for an EMG Controlled Prosthetic Hand. This hand was designed for kids with Upper limb loss with amputation across the wrist. Enclosed is the prototype software, design documents and the 3D model

# Design
The design has two main components: 3D Hand Model and Mechanical Movement
The 3D Hand Model is a redesign of the original opensource project from Open Bionics: https://openbionics.com/
The actual movement of the hand (my contribution to the project) is broken down into the following:
    1) EMG Signal Collection
    2) Actuator Response
    
# Summary of Files
Demo.ino is the prototype testing file and EMGControlledProstheticHand.pdf contains figures and images summarizing the connections and parts used in the design

# Current Work
Currently im working on automating the calibration process. During this project, I mainly did the all the calibration manually, would be interesting to see how I can store the data on a cloud platform and analyze it.
